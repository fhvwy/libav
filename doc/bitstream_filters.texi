@chapter Bitstream Filters
@c man begin BITSTREAM FILTERS

When you configure your Libav build, all the supported bitstream
filters are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using
the configure option @code{--list-bsfs}.

You can disable all the bitstream filters using the configure option
@code{--disable-bsfs}, and selectively enable any bitstream filter using
the option @code{--enable-bsf=BSF}, or you can disable a particular
bitstream filter using the option @code{--disable-bsf=BSF}.

The option @code{-bsfs} of the av* tools will display the list of
all the supported bitstream filters included in your build.

Below is a description of the currently available bitstream filters.

@section aac_adtstoasc

@section chomp

@section dump_extradata

@section extract_extradata

Extract the in-band extradata.

Certain codecs allow the long-term headers (e.g. MPEG-2 sequence headers,
or H.264/HEVC (VPS/)SPS/PPS) to be transmitted either "in-band" (i.e. as a part
of the bitstream containing the coded frames) or "out of band" (e.g. on the
container level). This latter form is called "extradata" in Libav terminology.

This bitstream filter detects the in-band headers and makes them available as
extradata.

@table @option
@item remove
When this option is enabled, the long-term headers are removed from the
bitstream after extraction.
@end table

@section h264_mp4toannexb

@section imx_dump_header

@section mjpeg2jpeg

Convert MJPEG/AVI1 packets to full JPEG/JFIF packets.

MJPEG is a video codec wherein each video frame is essentially a
JPEG image. The individual frames can be extracted without loss,
e.g. by

@example
avconv -i ../some_mjpeg.avi -c:v copy frames_%d.jpg
@end example

Unfortunately, these chunks are incomplete JPEG images, because
they lack the DHT segment required for decoding. Quoting from
@url{http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000063.shtml}:

Avery Lee, writing in the rec.video.desktop newsgroup in 2001,
commented that "MJPEG, or at least the MJPEG in AVIs having the
MJPG fourcc, is restricted JPEG with a fixed -- and *omitted* --
Huffman table. The JPEG must be YCbCr colorspace, it must be 4:2:2,
and it must use basic Huffman encoding, not arithmetic or
progressive. . . . You can indeed extract the MJPEG frames and
decode them with a regular JPEG decoder, but you have to prepend
the DHT segment to them, or else the decoder won't have any idea
how to decompress the data. The exact table necessary is given in
the OpenDML spec."

This bitstream filter patches the header of frames extracted from an MJPEG
stream (carrying the AVI1 header ID and lacking a DHT segment) to
produce fully qualified JPEG images.

@example
avconv -i mjpeg-movie.avi -c:v copy -bsf:v mjpeg2jpeg frame_%d.jpg
exiftran -i -9 frame*.jpg
avconv -i frame_%d.jpg -c:v copy rotated.avi
@end example

@section mjpega_dump_header

@section movsub

@section mp3_header_compress

@section mp3_header_decompress

@section noise

@section null
This bitstream filter passes the packets through unchanged.

@section remove_extradata

@section trace_headers

Log trace output containing all syntax elements in the coded stream
headers (everything above the level of individual coded blocks).
This can be useful for debugging low-level stream issues.

Supports H.264, H.265 and MPEG-2.

@section vp9_superframe

Combine VP9 frames into superframes.

@section vp9_superframe_split

Split VP9 superframes into single frames.

@section vp9_raw_reorder

Given a VP9 stream with correct timestamps but possibly out of order,
insert additional show-existing-frame packets to correct the ordering.
